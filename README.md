# Java App Starter

This is a basic Java app using the Swing framework, using Java SE 7 and later. This basic framework is for anybody who wants to create simple graphics applications in a very basic window.

I've borrowed basics from [tutorials found on www.zetcode.com](www.zetcode.com/tutorials/javagamestutorial) and I thank them heartily.
